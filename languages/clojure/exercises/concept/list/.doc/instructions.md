# Instructions

In this exercise you'll be writing code to process a list of programming languages you are planning to practice from Exercism platform.

- Create
- Add
- Remove
- Query
- Count

You have five tasks.

### 1. Create an empty list of programming languages

First, define an empty list.

### 2. Add 4 new programming languages to the list

Add 4 new programming languages you'd plan to practice:

- "Clojure"
- "Lisp"
- "Java"
- "JavaScript"

### 3. Remove 1 language from the list

After some thought, you want to remove "Lisp" from the list, as you might not have enough time for the year, and it's quite similar to Clojure.


### 4. Check that the removed language is not in the list anymore

You do a query and make sure that language "Lisp" is removed from the list

### 5. Count the total number of languages

Count the list and find the total number of languages.
